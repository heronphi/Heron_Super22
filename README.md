Supplemental Figure 1 caption: Overview of the 2D model results, showing plume timing after supercontinent formation plotted against plume distance from circum-supercontinent subduction zone for both Eastern (red) and Western (blue) regions. Approximate positions for plumes related to Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) and the Caribbean LIP (CLIP) are shown. Model results shown as: Model 1 circle; Model 2 square; Model 3 diamond; Model 4 cross; Model 5 plus; Model 6 hexagram; Model 7 asterix. 


Supplemental Figure 2 caption: Overview of the 2D model results, showing plume timing after supercontinent formation plotted against plume distance from circum-supercontinent subduction zone for both Eastern (red) and Western (blue) regions. Approximate positions for plumes related to Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) and the Caribbean LIP (CLIP) are shown. Model results are split into the different supercontinent coverage values: 20%: circle; 30%: square; 40%: diamond.
